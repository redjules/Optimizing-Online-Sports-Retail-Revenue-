# Optimizing Online Sports Retail Revenue 

In this project, we'll dive into product data for an online sports clothing company with the final goal of developing recommendations for the company to maximize its revenue. We will deal with a wide variety of information kept in several tables. The information includes prices, discounts, revenue, ratings, reviews, product descriptions, and website traffic. We will answer questions like:

- How do the price points of Nike and Adidas products differ?
- Is there a difference in the amount of discount offered between the brands?
- Is there any correlation between revenue and reviews? And if so, how strong is it?
- Does the length of a product's description influence a product's rating and reviews?
- Are there any trends or gaps in the volume of reviews by month?
- How much of the company's stock consists of footwear items? What is the median revenue generated by these products?
- How does footwear's median revenue differ from clothing products?
